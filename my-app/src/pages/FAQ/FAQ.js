      question: "What is the RuneScape Market Analyzer?",
      answer: "The RuneScape Market Analyzer is a dashboard tool that helps players make informed trading decisions on the Grand Exchange. It provides historical price data, market trend predictions, and profit calculation tools to help maximize your in-game trading profits."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the price prediction feature work?",
      answer: "Our price predictions use machine learning models trained on historical Grand Exchange data. While these predictions can indicate potential market trends, please remember they're not financial guarantees - always use your own judgment when trading."
    },
    {
      question: "How often is the data updated?",
      answer: "Item prices are updated every 5 minutes using the official Grand Exchange API. Historical data is maintained in our database and updated daily."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I use the Profit Calculator?",
      answer: "Simply enter an item name, your proposed buy/sell prices, and quantity. The calculator will automatically show your potential profit/loss after Grand Exchange fees. You can access it through the 'Calculator' tab in the dashboard."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I view historical price data beyond 180 days?",
      answer: "Yes! While the official API only provides 180 days of history, we maintain extended historical data in our database. Our charts show complete historical data for items we've tracked over time."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my RuneScape account information safe?",
      answer: "Absolutely. We don't require or store any RuneScape account credentials. All data comes from public APIs, and no personal information is needed to use our analyzer."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I search for a specific item's data?",
      answer: "Use the search bar at the top of any chart page. Start typing an item name and select from the auto-complete suggestions. You can search for any tradable Grand Exchange item."
    },
    {
      question: "What data sources does the app use?",
      answer: "We use the official RuneScape Grand Exchange API for real-time data and maintain our own SQL database for historical records. Player statistics come from the official Hiscores API."
    },
    {
      question: "Are the predictions guaranteed to be accurate?",
      answer: "While we use advanced machine learning models, the Grand Exchange is a dynamic player-driven market. Predictions are educated estimates based on historical patterns, not guarantees. Always diversify your investments."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I contact support?",
      answer: "Have questions or feedback? Email us at support@rsmarketanalyzer.com. For bug reports, please include your browser version and steps to reproduce the issue."
